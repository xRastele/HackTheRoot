<p>SQL Injection is a type of attack on web applications that allows manipulation of SQL queries sent to a database. This attack can lead to unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or even deletion of data.</p>

<h3>How Does SQL Injection Work?</h3>
<p>An SQL Injection attack involves injecting malicious SQL code into a query that the application sends to the database. For example, if an application does not properly filter user input, an attacker can introduce malicious code that will be executed by the database.</p>

<h3>Example of an Attack</h3>
<p>Suppose an application has a login form that asks for a username and password. The SQL query that verifies the user might look like this:</p>

<code>
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password';
</code>

<p>If an attacker enters the following in the username field:</p>

<code>
    ' OR '1'='1
</code>

<p>The SQL query becomes:</p>

<code>
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '$password';
</code>

<p>The condition '1'='1' is always true, so the query will return all users, allowing the attacker to log in without knowing the correct password.</p>

<h3>How to Defend?</h3>
<p>Defending against SQL Injection requires proper filtering and validation of user input and the use of secure database access methods, such as prepared statements and parameterized queries.</p>

<p>Remember, application security is an ongoing process and requires regular review and updates.</p>
